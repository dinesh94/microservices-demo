We have configure directory - D:\micro-spring\config-files
We need to make sure this directory is a git 

We have to do "git init" inside this directory & commit the comfiguration files present inside this directory so that those files will be available to client

You can also do more dynamic here, e.g. project name by setting up project name in system property or system environment variable
